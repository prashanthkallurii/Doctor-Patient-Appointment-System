Abstract:
This paper proposes an innovative Doctor-Patient Appointment System (DPAS) aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility and efficiency. In contemporary healthcare settings, appointment scheduling plays a pivotal role in ensuring timely access to medical services, yet existing systems often encounter inefficiencies, leading to prolonged waiting times and dissatisfaction among patients. DPAS employs advanced technologies such as machine learning algorithms, data analytics, and user-friendly interfaces to automate and optimize the appointment scheduling process. By analyzing historical appointment data and patient preferences, DPAS predicts future demand and allocates appointment slots accordingly, reducing wait times and optimizing resource utilization. Furthermore, the system incorporates features such as automated reminders, patient feedback mechanisms, and real-time updates, fostering better communication between healthcare providers and patients. Through simulations and case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of DPAS in improving appointment scheduling efficiency, enhancing patient satisfaction, and ultimately, facilitating better healthcare outcomes. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on healthcare optimization and underscores the significance of leveraging technology to address contemporary challenges in healthcare delivery.
